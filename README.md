## LETI practical number 3, semester 2

## About
You need to write a program that does the following:

1. Implements the transformation of the entered expression (if variables are used, the user must initialize them).

2. Implements a check for the correctness of a simple expression and an expression written in direct and reverse Polish notation (at the user's choice).

3. Implements the calculation of a simple expression and an expression written in direct and reverse Polish notation (user's choice).

The program should display and describe all intermediate actions.
